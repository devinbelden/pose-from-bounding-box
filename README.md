# Predicting 3D World Position Given A 2D Bounding Box
 For this project, we are taking a modified dataset procured from the [Peking University](https://www.kaggle.com/c/pku-autonomous-driving) Kaggle dataset, and seeing if we can use bounding boxes to predict the actual position in 3-dimensional space. In other words, we're trying to use monocular vision to "see" in three dimensions.
